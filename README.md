## CitizenConnect
This app helps users easily find and understand information about their elected representatives in India, including their MLA, MP, and local councillor. Users can either manually select their district or simply allow location access to see the representatives for their area.

Each representative is shown on an individual card. Tapping on a card opens a detailed profile that includes:

* How long the representative has been in office
* Total years of service
* Key achievements
* Amount of allocated funds spent
* Remaining funds
* Additional performance insights and background details

The goal of the app is to provide citizens with clear, accessible, and trustworthy information about the people who represent them.
